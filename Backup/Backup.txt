Sessions are backed up in this folder.

Unique session IDs are generated when the application is started.
Each unique session ID is created consisting of the IP address, the date, and an iterative number (1,2,3, â€¦).
For example: 159.17.216.157_2023.01.17_2). 

This way, a user can figure out a session ID and restore a session if it crashes or if a session needs to be resumed at a later time.

When the ID is created, a subfolder is created in this Backup folder labeled with the session ID and data objects from the session are stored in 'rdata' files.
If you need to restore a session in the app, Go to the 'Session Info' page, enter the session ID in the "Restore Session" field, and click the 'Restore Session' button.
The 'rdata' objects from the session folder will then be loaded into the app and the session will be restored and also saved in thee current session's folder.
